# Excel as a data base

Here I am experimenting with the use of excel as a database, and using google's APIs to make queries to it. 
The reason why I am doing this is not out of novelty, but in an organisation that heavily uses excel reporting, I thought it would be a cool idea to create data visualisers that pull data from the google sheets that is regularly edited. Maybe even using google form to input data into the excel data base and then a website can call APIs to the google sheets to present the data in a dashboard of some sort.

My aim is to be able to do this with no YouTube videos and just purely the documentation.
